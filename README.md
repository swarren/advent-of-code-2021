Solutions to http://adventofcode.com/2021

These solutions may not be optimal or idiomatic. In many cases, I implemented
them in languages completely new to me (Clojure, Ocaml, Postscript, Ruby), or
which are less familiar to be (Forth, Haskell) just to experiment with the
language. I sometimes chose to use certain language features in order to
experiment with them (e.g. Haskell SAT.MiniSat, or Clojure sequences),
irrespective of whether they were a good or idiomatic choice.
